Setting up Hadoop for KMeans

1. Download hadoop-1.0.4-bin.tar.gz from https://archive.apache.org/dist/hadoop/core/hadoop-1.0.4/
2. Extract the above tar file.
3. Using Eclipse to Compile your Hadoop Program into a jar file:
	3.1 Start Eclipse
	3.2 Create a Java Project with name as KMeansHadoop
	3.3 Copy the three files provided in kmeans-hadoop-code.
	3.4 Go to project -> properties-> Java Build Path-> Libraries add the following jar files as External Jars:hadoop-core-1.0.4.jar (path to hadoop-core-1.0.4.jar folder is <path to extracted hadoop-1.0.4 folder/hadoop-core-1.0.4.jar> ).
	3.5 Goto File ->Export -> Java -> Runnable JAR file-> Next
	3.6 Select the project that you want to export and give a suitable name and path for the jar file.
	3.7 Go Next->Next. 
	3.8 Set the name of the main class and then finish. Below we assume the jar file is in your home directory.


Running a Hadoop program:
1. Make a folder kmeans. Inside kmeans make 2 folders "data", "center"
2. Put datapoints file in "data" folder.
3. Place initial centroid centers in centers.txt file and place it inside center folder.
	3.1 You may choose any method to chosse initial cluster centers.
	3.2 We took top 5 points deom datapoints file.

Running Hadoop.
1. We hope that hadoop cluster setup is complete. 
2. Copy kmeans folder to hdfs .
	2.1 bin/hadoop dfs -copyFromLocal <path to kmeans folder> /user/hduser/kmeans
3. Execute
	3.1 bin/hadoop jar wc2.jar -D mapred.map.tasks=M mapred.reduce.tasks=R where M,R are the number of Map and Reduce task you want.
